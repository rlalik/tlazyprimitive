A demo for `TLazyPrimitive` class.

The idea behind this primitive is that it contains code which is executed at the `Draw()` call.

### Quick demo

Run `./run_test.sh`. You can pass option `-q` to the script to exit root automatically.

`lazy_demo.C` creates canvas with the lazy primitive.

`read_can.C` reads the root file created by the demo.
